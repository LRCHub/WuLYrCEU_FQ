Love it's a really big word
But haven't you heard
It's dangerous

And you
You think you it got locked down and figured out
And buttoned up

But I
I been burned enough so I learned enough
To watch my back

That's why
I'm warning you what you're about to do
Is as deadly as

Dancin' on the devil's stove
Playin with the fire below
Pushin' your luck, dippin' your toe
In the water
It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasin' down the hurricane
A bullet in a spinning revolver

Well a heart
It's a fragile thing
Hanging on a string
Don't take much
And a soul
Is a little bit strong, it takes a little longer
To use it up

But when
When it all comes down
'Cause it's gonna come down
You're gonna look around and wonder
How you got to where you're standing right now

Dancin' on the devil's stove
Playin' with the fire below
Pushin' your luck, dippin' your toe
In the water
It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasin' down a hurricane
A bullet in a spinning revolver

Dancin' on the devil's stove
Playin' with the fire below
Pushin' your luck
Dippin' your toe, in the water

It's a pedal down to race the train
Chasin' down the hurricane
A bullet in a spinning revolver

A pedal down to race the train
Chasin' down the hurricane
A bullet in a spinning revolver

Yeah!
