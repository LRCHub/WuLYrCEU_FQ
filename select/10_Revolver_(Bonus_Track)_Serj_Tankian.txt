Find me a revolver
Find me a bank robber
Anytime you need it
Call me and I'll take over

Find me a bank robber
Find me a revolver
Anytime you need it
Call me and I'll take over

The son of a tailor silently slain
Don't inform the public
They might start to sober
Then all your schemes and perils
Will all then be over
You can not afford to
Let your arms erase

All your crimes poisons, float out again
Place yourself on me, Chief
Your wounded might save
The son of a tailor silently slain

You cant really see me
I can hide all over
When I spend these billions
Your life will soon be over
Shoot the helicopters
Full of body armor

All your crimes poisons, float out again
Place yourself on me, Chief
Your wounded might save
The son of a tailor silently slain, slain

Die, da, da, die, die
Die, da, da, die, die
Die, da, da, die, die
Die, da, die

Find me a revolver
Find me a bank robber
Anytime you need it
Call me and I'll take over

Find me a bank robber
Find me a revolver
Anytime you need it
Call me and I'll take over
